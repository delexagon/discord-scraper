Good luck using this trash

How to use:  
have a linux computer (or wsl i guess)  
go into your internet console, go to the network section, then go to whatever conversation  
scroll all the way up  
'download as har' in the console  
run the extract messages script  
have fun  
recommended: check that there are the right number of messages  
almost certainly will not work on 'complicated' features (weren't in the dataset i used it on)
